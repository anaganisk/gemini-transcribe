# Gemini Transcribe

A web application for transcribing audio and video files using Google's Gemini Flash model. I find Flash interesting because of its multimodality. Unlike Whisper and friends, with Gemini Flash you can prompt for the desired transcription output as it also understands text. It also has built in speaker diarization, and can understand context in way that that a traditional speech-to-text system cannot. I have seen examples of it being used for things like detecting silence, tone, sentiment and sound effects.
