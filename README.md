# Gemini Transcribe

A web application for transcribing audio and video files using Google's experimental Gemini Flash model. This model offers an interesting approach to transcription by processing audio directly. Unlike Whisper and friends, with Gemini Flash you can prompt for the desired transcription output as its multimodal capabilities also allow it to understand text.
