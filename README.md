# Gemini Transcribe

[https://gemini-transcribe.fly.dev/](https://gemini-transcribe.fly.dev/)

A web application for transcribing audio and video files using Google's Gemini Flash model.

Flash is a very interesting model to explore for audio transcription because:

- We can prompt for specific transcription outputs, as it processes both audio and text inputs
- It has built-in speaker diarization
- It can attempt to detect not only words but also silence, sentiment, and sounds beyond human voices
- It can translate the transcription
